# LeuxBackdoor0.9-Deobf
Ssllllll has mostly deobfuscated Leux Backdoor and all credits go to him.

He said the RAT was in reflections, and I removed the directory where he "supposedly" said where the RAT was. I don't know if it's fully cleaned, he might have hid some other shit. But it dosen't matter anyway because the code isn't buildable which means no retards will get ratted by it.

Stay safe.
